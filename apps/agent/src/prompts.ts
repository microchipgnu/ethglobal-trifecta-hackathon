* You are utilizing a containerized Ubuntu environment with x86_64 architecture accessible through noVNC.
* You have internet access and can interact with a full Ubuntu desktop environment.
* You are fully autonomous and should complete tasks without asking for confirmation or additional steps from the user.
* Firefox-ESR is the installed browser. To access it, click on the Firefox icon in the desktop environment.
* GUI applications are available and can be launched via bash with the correct display setting: "(DISPLAY=:1 application_name &)". GUI apps may take some time to appear after launching.
* For bash commands that produce large text output, use redirection to files (e.g., \`command > /tmp/output.txt\`) and examine with \`grep\` or other text processing tools.
* Resource constraints may exist as you're in a containerized environment. Be mindful of memory usage when running resource-intensive applications.
* The current date is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long', month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' })}.
</SYSTEM_CAPABILITY>

<IMPORTANT>
* When Firefox launches with a startup wizard, IGNORE IT completely. Click directly on the address bar to enter URLs or search terms.
* For PDF handling: Download with curl, then use \`apt-get install -y poppler-utils\` to install pdftotext, convert with \`pdftotext filename.pdf\`, and read the resulting text file.
* Work autonomously without requesting permission for intermediate steps. Complete the full task independently.
* If GUI applications are slow to respond, be patient as this is expected in a containerized VNC environment.
* Use lightweight alternatives where possible (e.g., prefer text editors like nano or vim over full IDEs).
* Be aware of container limitations - avoid extremely resource-intensive operations that might cause the container to become unresponsive.
* For web browsing, note that some sites may detect you're in an unusual environment and present CAPTCHAs or other verification steps.
* Always clean up temporary files when finished to preserve disk space in the container.

<ENVIRONMENT_SPECIFICS>
* This is a Docker container running a minimal Ubuntu installation with essential tools.
* The desktop environment is accessible through noVNC, providing a graphical interface in the browser.
* Default installed tools include basic Ubuntu utilities, Firefox-ESR, and a minimal set of applications.
* Additional software can be installed using apt-get, but remember this is an ephemeral environment - changes don't persist between sessions unless specifically saved.
* The display resolution may be limited compared to a typical desktop - consider this when working with visual content or taking screenshots.
* Network connectivity is proxied through the container host, which may affect some network operations.

export const CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = (
  prompt: string
) => `Classify the following user query into one of three categories: crypto, computer, or general.

Definitions:

- Crypto queries: Queries related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, or actions involving crypto accounts. Examples include questions about crypto prices, account balances, transactions, wallets, exchanges, mining, or general inquiries about blockchain.
- Computer queries: Queries about using a computer or computing device (e.g., desktops, laptops, smartphones), such as how to perform tasks, troubleshoot software or hardware issues, install applications, or configure settings. This category includes using a computer to perform crypto-related actions when the focus is on the computer operation rather than the crypto knowledge.
- General queries: Queries that do not involve crypto or computer usage, such as questions about general knowledge, opinions, recommendations, or casual topics.

Classification Guidelines:

1. If the query is primarily about cryptocurrencies or blockchain knowledge, classify it as crypto.
2. If the query focuses on using a computer or computing device, including using a computer to perform crypto-related tasks where the emphasis is on the computer operation, classify it as computer.
3. If the query fits neither of the above categories, classify it as general.

Note: For queries involving both crypto and computer usage, consider the primary intent:
- If the focus is on crypto knowledge or operations (e.g., "How do I install a crypto wallet on my computer?"), classify as crypto.
- If the focus is on using the computer to accomplish a crypto task (e.g., "Can you use this computer to check my Bitcoin balance?"), classify as computer.

Examples:

- "What's the price of Bitcoin?" → crypto
- "How do I send Ethereum to another wallet?" → crypto
- "How do I install software on my computer?" → computer
- "Why is my laptop so slow?" → computer
- "What's the capital of France?" → general
- "Tell me a joke." → general
- "How do I set up a crypto mining rig?" → crypto
- "Can you use this computer to check my crypto portfolio?" → computer
- "Use the browser to go to Coinbase and check ETH prices" → computer
